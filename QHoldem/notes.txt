Quantum Hold'em
Quantum version of hold'em (as the name implies)

So far thinking of the game being 5 qubits with two randomly initialized (H measure) then the river being quantum gates selected from [I,X,H,Z,CNOT] usual poker betting rounds and then a new gate is 'applied' to the next qubit(s) at random

highest value or scoring system

scoring:
all 1s: 20
all 0s: 15
Palindrome:5
1 for each 1 (Max of 4)


+$10 to 'stand' costs more since you have full knowledge of the post-state
+$5 for new gate costs less since you lack knowledge of the post-state
or fold

to start with I think just trying to maximize the points/$ would be fine and give a concrete goal.


The game loop:
Prompt player for action
Execute depending on action
display new state
